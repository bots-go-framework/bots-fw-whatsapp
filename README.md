WhatsApp Cloud API adapter for [bots-fw](https://github.com/bots-go-framework/bots-fw),
built on [bots-api-whatsapp](https://github.com/bots-go-framework/bots-api-whatsapp).

## Persistence

This adapter declares narrow `SubjectStore`, `ChatDataStore`, and
`TemplateCatalog` ports and includes in-memory implementations. DALgo users can
inject their counterparts from
[`bots-fw-whatsapp-dalgo`](https://github.com/bots-go-framework/bots-fw-whatsapp-dalgo).
The adapter module retains all existing WhatsApp collection names and keys, so
no records need migration.

> **Status: early — the send path works, the receive path does not.** The
> customer-service-window gate, the responder (with progressive degradation),
> webhook signature verification, and inbound payload types are implemented and
> tested. The webhook handler, context, input types, and chat-data store are not.

## Our approach to development

We build with our own tooling:

- **[SpecScore](https://specscore.md)** — specify requirements as `SpecScore.md` artifacts
- **[SpecStudio](https://specscore.studio)** — author & manage specs across their lifecycle
- **[inGitDB](https://ingitdb.com)** — store structured data in Git where applicable
- **[cover100.dev](https://cover100.dev)** — drive toward 100% test coverage
- **[DataTug](https://datatug.io)** — query & explore data

## The 24-hour customer service window

This is the thing that makes WhatsApp structurally different from Telegram, and
most of this package exists because of it.

A business may send **free-form** messages only within **24 hours** of the
recipient's last reply. Outside that window the send fails with error `131047`,
and only a **pre-approved template** may be delivered.

A Telegram bot may message any chat it knows, at any time. That is a *Telegram
property*, not a universal one — so `bots-fw` had no way for a platform to say
"not now". [bots-fw#80](https://github.com/bots-go-framework/bots-fw/pull/80) added
the optional `botsfw.SendGate` interface for exactly this, and this package
supplies the first implementation.

The gate refuses an out-of-window free-form send **before** it reaches the API.
That matters: the attempt would not merely fail, it could deliver a **billable**
template the app never intended.

```go
gate := whatsapp.NewWindowGate(lastInboundProvider)
// Free-form 48h after the user's last reply -> refused, no API call made.
// A whatsapp.TemplateMessage -> permitted, because templates are the mechanism
// for reaching users outside the window.
```

### Sending a template

Templates are expressed via `MessageFromBot.BotMessage`, mirroring how Telegram
expresses `SendPhoto` with a `tgbotapi.PhotoConfig`:

```go
m := botmsg.MessageFromBot{
	ToChat: whatsapp.ChatID("16505551234"),
	BotMessage: whatsapp.TemplateMessage{
		Name:         "payment_reminder",
		LanguageCode: "en_US",
		BodyParams:   []string{"Jessica", "$40"},
	},
}
```

## Progressive degradation

**The app writes one rich message aimed at Telegram. This adapter fits it to
WhatsApp.** Messages are never rejected for being too rich, and Telegram is never
dragged down to WhatsApp's level — the lossy step lives here, in the only layer
that knows what WhatsApp cannot do.

The ladder, richest rung first:

| Buttons | Becomes | Callback routing |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | plain text | — |
| 1–3 | native reply buttons | **preserved** — data rides in the button id |
| 4–10 | a tap-to-open list | **preserved** — data rides in the row id |
| 11+ | a numbered text menu | lost — user replies with a number |

Other degradations, each reported rather than silent:

- **`IsEdit` → a new message.** WhatsApp has no edit endpoint, so the conversation
  is append-only and the original stays visible. This is the most user-visible
  difference from Telegram.
- **`FormatHTML` → plain text.** WhatsApp's markup is unverified, so no markup is
  emitted. `<a href="url">text</a>` becomes `text (url)` — URLs auto-hyperlink, so
  the destination stays reachable.
- **Button grids → flat.** `botkb` models `[][]Button` (Telegram rows); WhatsApp
  has no grid, so rows collapse. The actions survive, the layout doesn't.
- **URL buttons → inlined into the body.** WhatsApp reply buttons are type `reply`
  only and cannot carry links.
- **`switch_inline_query` buttons → dropped.** Inline mode is Telegram-only.
- **Over-long labels → truncated; duplicate labels → disambiguated.** Meta rejects
  both outright, so the adapter fixes them rather than failing the send.

Degradation is observable — wire up the callback and these become a running record
of where the WhatsApp experience diverges:

```go
responder.OnDegradation(func(ctx context.Context, m botmsg.MessageFromBot, notes []whatsapp.Degradation) {
	for _, n := range notes {
		logus.Warningf(ctx, "whatsapp degradation: %s", n)
	}
})
```

The one thing that gets **better** than Telegram: a reply button id allows **256
characters** against Telegram's 64-byte `callback_data` cap, so callback URLs port
without truncation.

## Why `LastInboundProvider` exists

The window needs one fact: **when did the user last reply?**

`bots-fw` looks like it already tracks this — `ChatBaseData.DtLastInteraction`.
It does not. `botswebhook/router.go` only stamps it when
`chatData.IsChanged() || chatData.HasChangedVars()`, so a reply that mutates
nothing leaves it stale. A window built on it would refuse sends that are in fact
permitted, silently.

So the adapter tracks last-inbound itself, and `LastInboundProvider` is the seam:

```go
type LastInboundProvider interface {
	LastInboundAt(ctx context.Context, chatID string) (time.Time, error)
}
```

Two rules the implementation must respect, both pinned by tests:

- **Only `messages` webhooks advance the window.** A `statuses` webhook is the fate
  of the *business's own* outbound message, and Meta sends up to three per message
  (sent / delivered / read). Counting those would hold the window open forever on
  the bot's own traffic.
- **A lookup failure fails open.** A store outage is our problem, not a platform
  refusal; failing closed would silently drop real messages.

## Webhook security

```go
// Subscription handshake (GET): echoes hub.challenge after a constant-time
// verify-token comparison; 403 and silent otherwise.
whatsapp.HandleVerification(w, r, verifyToken)

// Event notifications (POST): HMAC-SHA256 over the RAW body, keyed by app secret.
err := whatsapp.ValidateSignature(r.Header.Get(whatsapp.SignatureHeader), rawBody, appSecret)
```

Validate **before** decoding. Meta signs the bytes on the wire, so a re-marshalled
payload will not verify — there is a test pinning exactly that.

Note this does not fit `bots-fw`'s `WebhookSecretToken`, which models Telegram's
"echo a shared secret in a header". WhatsApp signs over the body instead.

## Roadmap

Implemented:

- `botsfw.BotPlatform` for `botsfwconst.PlatformWhatsApp`
- The 24h window + `botsfw.SendGate` implementation
- **Progressive degradation** of rich messages (buttons → list → text; HTML → plain;
  edit → new message), with every loss reported via `OnDegradation`
- The responder, incl. interactive reply buttons and list messages
- `TemplateMessage` (named and positional body parameters)
- `ChatID` — a phone-number `botmsg.ChatUID` (`botmsg.ChatIntID` is an `int64` and
  cannot carry a `wa_id`)
- Webhook signature validation and the `hub.challenge` handshake
- Inbound payload types, with `messages` vs `statuses` correctly separated

Not yet implemented:

- The `botsfw.WebhookHandler` tying the above together, and `WebhookContext`
- `botinput` input types, and the `LastInboundProvider` store implementation
- Interactive `button_reply` / `list_reply` **inbound** payloads (outbound is done) —
  the inbound shape has a dedicated Meta reference page not yet read, and guessing a
  wire shape is not worth it
- Media, location, contacts
- **Deduplication.** Meta explicitly states *"your server should handle
  deduplication"* on retries over 36 hours. `bots-fw`'s `IsNewerThen` /
  `UpdateLastProcessed` contract is unimplemented and uncalled, so this needs
  solving here or upstream.

## Known constraints

Verified against Meta's docs while building this. Full records in the private
backstage repo.

| | |
|---|---|
| Reply buttons | **max 3**, flat, no grid. Labels ≤ 20 chars. Button id ≤ 256 chars — *more* than Telegram's 64-byte `callback_data` cap, so callback payloads port fine. The count does not. |
| List messages | max 10 sections, but **10 rows across all sections combined** |
| Groups | **max 8 participants**, invite-only, requires an Official Business Account. Templates work; **interactive messages do not**. Per-message pricing |
| Callback ack | **none** — taps arrive as ordinary inbound messages. No `answerCallbackQuery` analogue |
| Edit message | **no edit endpoint** — the Messages API enumerates 40+ operations and all are `Send` |
